# Mahābhārata Android App

An Android application that presents the **Mahābhārata**, one of the greatest epics of ancient India, composed by the sage **Vyāsa**. This app is based on the work curated by [@termite_colony](https://twitter.com/termite_colony), who is translating the **BORI Critical Edition (BORI CE)** of the Mahābhārata.

## 📖 About the Text

1. Ādiparvan
2. Sabhāparvan
3. Āraṇyakaparvan
4. Virāṭaparvan
5. Udyogaparvan
6. Bhīṣmaparvan
7. Droṇaparvan
8. Karṇaparvan
9. Śalyaparvan
10. Sauptikaparvan
11. Strīparvan
12. Śāntiparvan
13. Anuśāsanaparvan

15. Āśramavāsikaparvan
16. Mausala­parvan
